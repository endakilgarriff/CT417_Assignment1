## This assignment aims to reinforce understanding of some modern software development frameworks - specifically using Maven, Jitpack, JUnit, git and GitHub, and Shippable CI

**There are 3 main parts:**
- [ ] Part A - Create student registration system in Java and test using JUnit
- [ ] Part B - A second Maven project adds the project release in part A as a dependency using Jitpack
- [ ] Part C - Use Shippable CI to automate the build

**The devliverables for this assignment are as follows:**
- [ ] Links to your Github repositories which contain the source code for part a) and b).
- [ ] Log files /screenshots from your local build (of part b)) / test run (of part a)), as well as a
screenshot of the console output of part b).
- [ ] Screenshots of your local revision histories, i.e. your Git commits, for part a) and part b).
- [ ] Screenshots from Shippableâ€™s Jobs and Insights pane to see the build history of the
automatic build of part a).
